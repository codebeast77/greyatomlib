This helps us to decide the man of the match and batsman with highest no of six.

Note that you have to return the filter array itself, not the records with sixes

Create a function that answers this question.

Write a function with to get the number of sixes 
scored by a batsman with following specifications.

**The function should**
- Be named `get_all_sixes_filter`
- Accept no parameters
- Work on the previously created `ipl_matches_array` object
- Should return an integer count of all the matches for which the given team has won the toss

## How many deliveries did a given batsman bat in total?

One of the most important factor for analysing 
a batsman's performance is number of deliveries faced by him.
Let's create a function that answers this question.

Write a function to get the number of deliveries 
faced by a batsman with following specifications.

**The function should**
- Be named `get_total_deliveries_played`
- Accept one mandatoy parameter named `batsman`
- Work on the previously created `ipl_matches_array` object
- Should return an integer count of all deliveries that this given batsman played

# Analysing House Prices using Descriptive Statistics

We have seen in the in-class session how Descriptive Statistics helps us understand  the data carefully. We learnt about:

* Measures of centrality
* Measures of spread
* Correlation 

You can use any numpy and matplotlib objects for the purpose of this exercise.

## Dataset

For this exercise, we will use the House Prices dataset, which we have already discussed in the session. 
The dataset contains `SalePrice` of around 1400 houses. The dataset is a part of a larger dataset.
You can read about the description [here](https://github.com/MayureshShilotri/GA_extended_content/blob/master/Data/house_pricing/data_description.txt).

## Why solve this assignment?

We will

* Learn to summarise huge datasets using a small number of parameters
* Learn how correlation can be an important tool to understand data, but also can mislead to spurious insights

* For the assignment we will be using the following below packages:
    * **matplotlib**
    * **numpy**
    * **pandas**
    
    
Let's get started!

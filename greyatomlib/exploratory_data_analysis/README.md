# EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) Implementation using Python

We have seen in the lectures how EDA helps in first level of analysis of data.

EDA helps use to analyse the following types of features:
* Categorical Features

* Numerical Features

You can revise and refer to the EDA from the slides.

# Learn to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to Plot the Features

## Dataset
We will be using House Pricing dataset. 

We have been working with this dataset for some time now. 

Let's try to perform some visualization on it and get some meaningful insights.

#### Features:

* YearBuilt
* TotalBsmtSF
* GrLivArea 
* SalePrice

## Why solve this assignment?

* We will analyse the data before making any intuition or assumptions, by plotting it.
* To sharpen your analytics skills before going into feature selection.


For the assignment we will be using the below packages :
* matplotlib
* seaborn


##Let's get started!

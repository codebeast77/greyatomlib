# Make a Runs Fequency Table

In a single delivery, a batsman can score minimim of 0 runs and maximum of 6 runs. Let's try to get an idea of how many runs do batsmen make in a single ball. We can do it by creating a frequancy table of "runs scored".

## Write a function `get_run_counts` that
- Returns a pandas Series with runs as the index and their frequencies (counts) as the values

You can use previously created function (`read_csv_data_to_df`) to import csv into a dataframe.

### Parameters
The function takes no parameters

### Returns
- runs_count: runs scored and count of occurences `dtype: Series`

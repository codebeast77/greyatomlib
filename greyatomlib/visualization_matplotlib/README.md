# Python Day 05 - Matplotlib Assignments

## What have we learnt so far?
* Understand the need for Pandas in Data Science
* Matplotlib basics: Figure, SubPlots, Labels, Plots
* Various types of plots: Bar, Scatter, Box, etc.
* Configuring  Matplotlib plots

This project challenges you to understand and analyze data through visualization. One principal truth in the science of data is that breakthroughs are difficult if you don't intuitively "understand" the data. Visualization is important because it helps us to gain insights before making any assumptions or taking on false biases. We will see in the future how this also helps us in feature-selection.

## About the dataset
We will continue to use our good old IPL dataset, but we'll be able to 'see' it in a completely new light!
